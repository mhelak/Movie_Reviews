Deriving meaning from text is highly in demand across disciplines in data science. Sentiment Analysis is one common application of NLP. This project served as an exercise to practice NLP concepts and test out the performance of different models on text data.

The objective of the project was to build a classification model that is able to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text descriptions. The project was inspired by a former Kaggle competition. The data can be found here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/\

I created a model that can accurately predict a binary outcome for both types of reviews with equal importance. The steps to build the model included exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, building three different models, and evaluating the performance of my models by looking at assumptions, advantages and disadvantages as well as their F1 score.
